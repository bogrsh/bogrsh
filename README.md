### Hi there, I'm Gordey Bogorosh 👋

**DevOps Engineer | Unix Aficionado | Classical Music Enthusiast**

#### 💻 About Me

I'm a 25-year-old DevOps Engineer passionate about building robust, scalable, and efficient systems. I have a deep appreciation for the elegance and power of foundational technologies that form the backbone of modern infrastructure.

*   **I work with:** Linux, Unix, Bash, Vim, and the entire ecosystem of DevOps tools.
*   **I'm inspired by:** The principles of simplicity, automation, and reliability.
*   **I'm currently exploring:** Deepening my expertise in cloud-native technologies, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

When I'm not optimizing pipelines or architecting cloud solutions, I find a similar sense of structure and beauty in classical music and ballet.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Operating Systems:** Linux, Unix
*   **Scripting & Automation:** Bash/Shell
*   **Editor of Choice:** Vim
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Prometheus, Grafana

#### 🎵 Beyond the Terminal

My interests outside of tech reflect my love for precision, harmony, and timeless art:
*   🎻 **Classical Music**
*   💃 **Ballet**

I believe the discipline and structure found in these arts are not so different from the principles of writing clean code and designing resilient systems.
